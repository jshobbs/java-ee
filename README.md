# java-ee
This is a web application project that uses JEE with Tomcat. Maven was used to build this project. 
Hibernate was used as the ORM, and JUnit tests were implemented. Spring was implemented by using
annotation. This project will eventually be a single page application using Angularjs. The front-end
uses HTML, CSS, and Angular as the two-way data binding.
