# java-ee
## Java Web Application
This is a web application project that uses JEE with Tomcat. Maven was used to build this project. 
Hibernate was used as the ORM, and JUnit tests were implemented. Spring was implemented by using
annotation. This project will eventually be a single page application using Angularjs. The front-end
uses HTML, CSS, and Angular as the two-way data binding.

To use the application, import the Maven application into Eclipse and build the WAR file using the
mvn clean install command. Then copy the WAR file to the servlet. To run in a test environment, you 
can just run it in Eclipse. If you are using a Tomcat server on your development machine, use port 8080.
